Grease
======

PHP editor written in PHP using wxPHP .. still early days.

To get up and running under Archlinux, download https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/php-wxwidgets-git/ and build with makepkg.  Setup php.ini to load wxwidgets.so module and run `php grease.wxphp` from the commandline.

If you need help I'm currently lurking in: irc.freenode.net #wxphp
